# single-cell-RNA-sequencing-scRNA-seq-data
#There are several packages available in Python that can be used for scRNA-seq analysis, such as `scanpy`, `Seurat`, and `scikit-learn`. Here's an example code using the `scanpy` package to perform basic scRNA-seq analysis:
import scanpy as sc

# Load the scRNA-seq data
adata = sc.read('path_to_data.h5ad')

# Preprocess the data
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_counts=1)  # Filter out genes with low counts
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata)  # Normalize the data
sc.pp.log1p(adata)  # Log-transform the data

# Perform dimensionality reduction
sc.pp.pca(adata)  # Perform PCA
sc.pp.neighbors(adata)  # Compute neighborhood graph
sc.tl.umap(adata)  # Compute UMAP coordinates

# Cluster the cells
sc.tl.leiden(adata)  # Perform Leiden clustering

# Visualize the results

#In this code, you would need to replace `'path_to_data.h5ad'` with the actual path to your scRNA-seq data file in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) format. The code performs basic preprocessing steps, dimensionality reduction using PCA and UMAP, clustering using the Leiden algorithm, and visualization of the results. It also includes differential expression analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed between clusters.

#now lets do it with sikit-learn
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the scRNA-seq data
data = np.loadtxt('path_to_data.txt')

# Preprocess the data
# ... (perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalization or log transformation)

# Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)

# Perform clustering using K-means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(reduced_data)

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(reduced_data[:, 0], reduced_data[:, 1], c=clusters)
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.title('scRNA-seq Clustering')
plt.show()

#Run code in Notebook

#Replace selection

#In this code, you would need to replace `'path_to_data.txt'` with the actual path to your scRNA-seq data file. The code performs PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering on the reduced data. Finally, it visualizes the results by plotting the data points in the reduced space with different colors representing different clusters.
